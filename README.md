# Deep_learning
## Introduction
Here is my python source code for coding deeplearning based on several datasets as well as re-coding other insteresting projects. This reporsitory includes some small projects which it takes me about 2 weeks or more for each one.

#### First porject
I used to CNN of deeplearning to extract feature image based on fashion-mnist dataset.

#### Second project
I re-coded nvidia's project which is  using CNN to predict driving angles based on steering car.
