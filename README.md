# Deep_learning
## Introduction
Here is my python source code for coding deeplearning based on several datasets as well as re-coding other insteresting projects. This reporsitory includes some small projects which it takes me about 2 weeks or more for each one.

#### First porject
I used to CNN of deeplearning to extract feature image based on fashion-mnist dataset and cifar-10. I also used keras tuner library to choose the best hyperparameters for model.

#### Second project
I re-coded nvidia's project which is  using CNN to predict driving angles based on steering car.

</p>


#### Third project
I used Alexnet and VGG16 model for tranfer learning, fine-tuning, train from scrath, using weight of alexnet as initial weight for dog and cat dataset and then I deployed on the website.

#### Fourth project
I implemented style tranfering.
